# Palindrome Checker

## Overview

This project is a Palindrome Checker app that allows users to determine whether a given word or phrase is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.  
Project is a part of JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification by [CodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/build-a-palindrome-checker-project/build-a-palindrome-checker).

## Features

- **Input Handling:** The app handles user input by removing all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces, and symbols) and converting the remaining characters to the same case (lower or upper case).

- **Palindrome Checking:** The core functionality of the app is to check whether the processed input is a palindrome. It evaluates the input to see if it reads the same way forward and backward.
